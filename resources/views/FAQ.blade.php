                        The best time to work out is whenever you can fit it in! Have a
                        look at your schedule and figure out what time of day is best for
                        you. If your routine is flexible, think about when you feel most
                        energetic, or when you would prefer to exercise. Morning workouts
                        can be an energising way to start the day for some, while others
                        prefer working out in the afternoons or evenings. Consistency is
                        what matters, so focus on working out when it works best for you,
                        which will make it more enjoyable and easier to stick to!

                        Your diet plays a huge role in the overall success of your new
                        routine. Regardless of your goals, it is important to give your
                        body the fuel and energy it needs to crush and recover from your
                        workouts. There are tons of diets out there, and really when it
                        comes down to it, the choice is personal. If I can give a general
                        piece of advice, it would be to simply focus on including more
                        whole foods in your diet. If you want to show up for your workout
                        and perform your best, the nutrients you're filling your body with
                        matter. The quality and content of what you eat make a difference,
                        so try maximizing fresh foods where you can. For all my fitness
                        newbies out there, I hope this article is a good starting point
                        that helps you frame the building blocks of your new routine!
                        While beginning a new fitness journey can be daunting, do not
                        stress about the details too much. As you get going, you’ll start
                        getting the hang of it and learning from those around you. Do not
                        be afraid to ask questions. Let us know in the comments your
                        fitness questions! We’d be happy to help.

                        When it comes to weight loss, I like to focus on a full-scale
                        approach. Regular cardio training is great for increasing your
                        daily calorie burn. While strength training will help you build
                        lean muscle, which will increase your metabolism and help you burn
                        more calories at rest! I’d also recommend adding in a few HIIT
                        sessions per week, rather it is your favorite type of cardio, body
                        weight, or light dumbbell exercises. HIIT is designed to get your
                        body working at high intensities, burning a ton of calories in a
                        short period of time. Create a schedule with a blend of regular
                        cardio, a few full body strength training sessions, and a few HIIT
                        training sessions each week. Finally, don not forget to eat a
                        healthy, well-balanced diet emphasizing whole foods. With weight
                        loss it is important to maximize the nutrients in the calories
                        you are consuming to fuel your workouts!

                        The fundamental principle to a healthy diet comes down to one
                        word; balance. Many other factors are included to ensure a
                        balanced diet, but essentially eating enough food that provides
                        the range of nutrients your body requires encourages the promotion
                        of good health. It is important to ensure this variety of foods,
                        guaranteeing a broad range of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals
                        that your body needs. When you are receiving too little or too
                        much of certain elements, this can result in health problems. That
                        is why moderation and control of your diet is important. For
                        example, fats are a necessary part of your diet, but when they
                        exceed the body’s required amount, it can be stored in the body,
                        potentially causing problems, most importantly cardiovascular
                        issues.

                        The BMI gives a pretty accurate measure of body fat, but the scale
                        has limits. It's really only applicable to "ordinary" people 20 to
                        65 years of age. The BMI is not an appropriate measure for
                        children, for the elderly, for pregnant and nursing women, or for
                        heavily muscled athletes. For the rest of us, however, it does
                        give a snapshot of how fat we are. Most people with a BMI of 26
                        don't think of themselves as overweight, but consider this: The
                        risk of heart diseases, diabetes, and high blood pressure actually
                        begins to rise at BMIs of around 22, rather than 26. When experts
                        wrote the USDA's 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, they
                        briefly considered using a BMI of 22 as a cut-off for "normal"
                        weight, but realizing this would label the vast majority of
                        Americans as overweight they settled on a threshold BMI of 25
                        instead.

                        Doing 100 sit-ups a day won’t guarantee a defined set of abs;
                        you will need to do a combination of things. Reducing body fat
                        should be first on the agenda – you may have the strongest set of
                        abdominal muscles but if your body fat percentage is too high, you
                        won’t be able to see them. Be sure to include some fat-burning
                        HIIT training and cardio in your routine. However, diet is
                        arguably the most important factor if you want to get lean. Use
                        apps such as My Fitness Pal to track your calorie intake and if
                        weight loss is your goal, ensure you are in a calorie deficit
                        (burning more calories than you eat). When you have reached your
                        body fat goals, it is time to target the abdominals and increase
                        their muscle mass through your training. Great core exercises
                        include plank variations, bicycle crunches and cable rotations, or
                        try abs-specific classes at the gym.
